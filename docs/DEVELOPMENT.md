# Development

## Prerequisites

-   `npx` and `npm` commands available
-   `Expo Go` -app installed on mobile

Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the development server

1. Run `npx expo start` to start the development server
2. Scan the QR-code from the terminal with the `Expo go` -app
3. Make changes and see hot reload working

You can also open `localhost:8081` to view the project on the web.

## The long way

You can also install SDK etc. and run the project that way. Look up react native docs for that if
you like to torture yourself like that.
